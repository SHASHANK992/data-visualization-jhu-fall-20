Data Visualization
Final Project

### How to run the code
The zip folder contains a folder named Python and a folder named R (along with
this Code_documentation.txt). Additionally, included is the final paper called,
'yu_final_paper.pdf.' There are a total of six visualizations in the
project. Below will be shown how each of the visualizations are created.

# Visualization 1
Located in the Python folder is another folder called 'visualization1.' Inside the
folder are four files. The 'screenshot_visualization1.jpg' is a screenshot of the
visualization after it's generated. The file 'visualization1.html' contains the
visualization as a complete object that can be opened and viewed. The dataset for
this visualization is contained within 'time_series_covid_19_confirmed.csv.' The
code that runs this visualization is located in 'visualization1.ipynb' which is a
jupyter notebook. The code should run fine from top to bottom.

# Visualization 2
Located in the Python folder is another folder called 'visualization2.' Inside the
folder are four files. The 'screenshot_visualization2.jpg' is a screenshot of the
visualization after it's generated. The file 'visualization2.html' contains the
visualization as a complete object that can be opened and viewed. The dataset for
this visualization is contained within 'time_series_covid_19_confirmed.csv.' The
code that runs this visualization is located in 'visualization2.ipynb' which is a
jupyter notebook. The code should run fine from top to bottom.

As a note, this jupyter notebook contains code which should generate two additional
datasets. The datasets are called 'python_melt.csv' and 'lag_data.csv.' Both are used
in later visualizations. However, to use those later visualizations it's not required
to move them there since those folders already contain copies of these datasets.

# Visualization 3
Located in the Python folder is another folder called 'visualization3.' Inside the
folder are four files. The 'screenshot_visualization3.jpg' is a screenshot of the
visualization after it's generated. The file 'visualization3.html' contains the
visualization as a complete object that can be opened and viewed. The dataset for
this visualization is contained within 'time_series_covid_19_confirmed.csv.' The
code that runs this visualization is located in 'visualization3.ipynb' which is a
jupyter notebook. The code should run fine from top to bottom.

# Visualization 4
Located in the R folder is another folder called 'visualization4.' Inside the
folder are four files. The 'screenshot_visualization4.jpg' is a screenshot of the
visualization after it's generated. The datasets for this visualization are both
contained within the folder and are called 'lag_data.csv' and 'python_melt.csv.' The
code that runs this visualization is located in 'visualization4.R' which is an
R script. The code should run fine from top to bottom.

As a note, the screenshot is of the main visualization, there's a minor graph that is
used in the report as an example for comparing the graph of China's current data and
a subset that looks only at the first 20 days which is not included in the screenshot.

# Visualization 5
Located in the R folder is another folder called 'visualization5.' Inside the
folder are four files. The 'screenshot_visualization5.jpg' is a screenshot of the
visualization after it's generated. The datasets for this visualization are both
contained within the folder and are called 'lag_data.csv' and 'python_melt.csv.' The
code that runs this visualization is located in 'visualization5.R' which is an
R script. The code should run fine from top to bottom.

As a note, the screenshot is of the main visualization, there are three minor graphs
that are used in the report as an example for comparing the graph of China's growth
rate, the curvy growth rate countries, and the straight growth rate countries. Screenshots
of these plots are in the main report and are not included as separate screenshots.

# Visualization 6
The steps for this visualization are slightly more complicated. The order of how the
visualizations could be recreated is to first go to the Python folder and enter
the folder called 'visualization6.' Within this folder are four files. The data files
are 'covid_19_data.csv' and 'sunburst_edit.csv.' The screenshot of the visualization
working is also within this folder and is called 'screenshot_visualization6.jpg.' The
jupyter notebook with the code is called 'visualization6.ipynb.'

Opening the file, 'visualization6.ipynb,' the code will require 'covid_19_data.csv.' This
will then generate a new data file called 'sunburst.csv.' The file 'sunburst.csv' is already
located in the directory /R/visualization6/. This other directory includes two files, the
'sunburst.csv' file that was just generated and an R script called 'visualization6.R.' This
R script is used to do some data wrangling to help aggregate some rows using RStudio. The
task itself was troublesome in Python so it was done in R quickly. After running the R
script, it will generate a new file called, 'sunburst_edit.csv.' This file is included
in /Python/visualization6/.

Going back to 'visualization6.ipynb,' the jupyter notebook will run the data file called
'sunburst_edit.csv.' This generates the last visualization which can be opened in
'visualization6.html.' The code should run fine from top to bottom.

NOTE: Running the jupyter notebooks will generate an additional folder containing
checkpoint files.
